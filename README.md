# ADESS

*Adess* (artist directed engine sound synthetizer) is a CLI application for generating engine sounds. *Adess* doesn't generate the sound in real-time, rather using keyframes for animating the engine behaviour.

## Requirements

- CMake (`https://github.com/Kitware/CMake`)
- libsndfile (`https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile`)

## Installation:
- On Linux / MacOS
	1. clone the repository:
	```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LeonKubota/adess.git
	```
	2. compile:
		```bash
		cd build
		cmake ..
		make
		```
	I suggest adding *adess* to your `$PATH` for convenience.
- On Windows:
	1. ???
	2. ???
	3. ???
